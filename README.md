LuaOO
=====

python style Lua object-orient program, support mixin

code style similar to @middleclass, but call member function use x.func() instead of x:func()

member function total same to normal function, so you can pass x.func as callback.

like python, func contains information of caller

if you think it's good, pleas click the star button.

poor english, sorry
